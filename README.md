# RentReminderBot

A silly discord bot that reminds me and my friends when we have to pay rent. We named it Helen.
The rest is our own silly additions


Usage requires your bot token in a file next to `main.py` called `token` (Highly reccomended to add this file to a `.gitignore`)
You must also put a channel id in a file next to `main.py` called `channel` (Highly reccomended to add this file to a `.gitignore`)

You may also want to double check what `daysBeforeWarn` is set to. I like to use 5 as a default.
